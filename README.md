# PythonProjectTemplate
Python Project Template/Skeleton

The purpose of this repository is to have all the files, folders and style conventions that are usually part of a
standard python project in a single location.

Some things might not make sense for every project, but overall the most import elements are here.

I created this template for my own personal use, but feel free to use it.

## How to use
Just copy the `Project` folder or
[use this template directly](https://github.com/Kronopt/PythonProjectTemplate/generate) to start a new python project.
